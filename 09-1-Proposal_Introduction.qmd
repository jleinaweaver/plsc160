## PLSC 160: Inquiry in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

Designing a "good" research proposal requires:

- A compelling research question,

- A foundation in the academic literature, and 

- A clear theoretical story to test

::: notes

The proposal you are working on now (at least at an intuitive level)

:::



## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center .smaller}

Submit a research proposal for the project we have been developing in class during the first half of the semester 

- This proposal must include three separate sections: An introduction, a literature review and a theoretical argument (with hypotheses)
    - The introduction section should introduce your research question and make an argument that it is important
    - The literature review section should summarize and evaluate the academic literature while making an argument about the "best" approach for moving forward with this project
    - The theory section should explain your answer to the research question with a DAG, the key assumptions in your model, and the hypotheses you plan to test

::: {.fragment}
- Each section should be written as a complete argument that connects to the next one (organized to advance a thesis, with clear macro and meso structures)

- Be sure to consult the "Submission Requirements for the Argument Papers" in the syllabus

Details taken from the Canvas assignment prompt

- REVEAL x1

- Proposal is due at the end of next week (Oct 25)

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Let's work for a bit on the introduction argument

- Everybody spend 10 minutes brainstorming premises to support the argument that we have an important research question

- Aim for a much longer list then you'll need, e.g. 10 reasons!

<br>

PAIRS: Compare lists and try to lock in on the three strongest reasons

<br>

Now take some time to find at least one piece of evidence to support each of your chosen premises

<br>

SLIDE: Ok, the rest of your time today is to work, but first!
