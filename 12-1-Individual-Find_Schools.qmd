### Section 1: The Introduction

- Make an argument that answering your research question is important

<br>

### Outline

- A "good" research question

- A three premise importance argument with evidence

At this point everyone has a good outline / first draft of Section 1 of their proposal

<br>

SLIDE: Now we shift to Section 2, the Literature Review

<br>

### Section 2: The Literature Review

- What are the current answers to your RQ?

<br>

### The Fundamentals of the Literature Review

1. What are the relevant schools?
2. How does each answer the question?
3. Strengths and weaknesses of each school?
4. Which is "best" for your project?

Your work today in class is building up to writing this section of your proposal

<br>

To do this, today I want each of you to consider the literature reviews in the three articles you brought to class

- Each article should have covered and organized the established literature into "schools of thought"

- Rather than reinvent the proverbial wheel, I want you to consider the options presented in these published articles

- Your goal is to decide on the three "schools of thought" you will use in your proposal

<br>

**Questions on the task for today?**

- Let's get to work and we'll check in before the end of class to make sure everyone has selected their three schools

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

<br>

### Gathering the Literature

- Submit APA citations for **TWO** relevant and recent political science journal articles for **EACH** of your selected "schools of thought"

- To include an article in your list you MUST have access to the pdf

::: notes

This means you are adding six new articles to the three you already have from today

- That's nine total articles by next class

<br>

**Any questions on the assignment?**
