Today we enter Section 4 of the semester which is focused on "completing" your research proposals

<br>

Completing your research proposal for this class requires two elements:

1. The first task is to revise and reframe your first paper

2. The second task is to propose an answer to your research question (e.g. a theory)

<br>

Let's start with the first task focused on revising and reframing your first paper

- **SLIDE**: The old prompt

**Proposal Paper 1: Important Research Question**
:::

<br>

**Assignment Prompt**

- What is the research question motivating your proposal and why is it important?

- Importance Criteria: Impact on the real world

::: notes

Here's the prompt for the first paper.

<br>

I asked each of you to  propose a "good" research question and then to make an argument it was "important"

- This importance argument was rooted in the empirical world

- In other words, you showed the reader why your topic was impactful in the political world

<br>

**SLIDE**: Turns out, in scientific research, real world impact is only half the job of making an importance argument

**Proposal Paper 3: REVISED Important Research Question**
:::

<br>

**Assignment Prompt**

- What is the research question motivating your proposal and why is it important?

- Importance Criteria: 

    - Impact on the real world, AND
    
    - Impact on the academic literature

::: notes

Your task in the third paper is to revise your first paper so that your importance argument does both of these things

- The new element of importance requires you to explicitly connect your work to established scientific literature

<br>

Remember, the scientific research is our best estimate of current knowledge

- e.g. what we know about why the world works the way it does

<br>

This means your question is important ONLY if it:

1. Is connected to issues of importance in the real world,

2. Builds on what has come before it, AND

3. Proposes to push us beyond what we already know

<br>

In short, the importance argument must show that the topic is impactful in the political world AND that it fills a gap in the academic literature

<br>

The funny thing is that you can't easily do this from the beginning of the project

- You need a draft question to guide you to the relevant literature

- Then you have to summarize, organize and analyze that literature BEFORE you can make the argument your RQ is important to science!

<br>

Your next job is to take your expertise back to the research question!

- Is your original question something we don't already have a good answer to?

- How could we tweak your question to make it target the unknown more precisely?

<br>

**Any questions on this new element of importance?**

- **SLIDE**: Let's now use your Canvas submissions to discuss your expert reflections on your original research questions

:::



## Big Question {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### Has your specific question been thoroughly asked and answered in the literature already?

::: notes

**So, did anybody discover that their research question has been asked and answered?**

<br>

There is no shame in this!

- Discovering this is part of the process and it turns out that tweaking your research question isn't usually very hard

- Before we do tweaks, let's see if we have any other problems...

<br>

**SLIDE**: Big question tweaked

:::



## Big Question (redux) {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### How close is your question to the asked and answered questions in the literature?

::: notes

**Is anybody's question uncomfortably close to an asked and answered question?**

<br>

This is a VERY common outcome from completing a literature review

- The good news is that your LR is the key to fixing the RQ!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next step

:::



## What do we "know"? {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### Based on your research, what do we understand well in your topic? 

::: notes

Ok, get ready to report back on this:

- In your topic, what does the research suggest we know well?

- What questions have been asked and answered well?

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS examples*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Time for the other side of the coin

:::



## Finding the Gaps {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### Based on your research, what do we NOT understand well in your topic? 

<br>

::: {.fragment}

### Brainstorm a RQ for each of the identified gaps in our knowledge

:::

::: notes

Ok, now I want you to make us a list

- What do we NOT understand well in your topic?

- Let's aim for a list of AT LEAST five things we do not know

- If you're looking for help on this, consider the "future research needs" mentioned in the conclusions of most research articles

- Go!

<br>

**Does everybody have a list of AT LEAST FIVE unknowns drawn from the literature you've been exploring?**

<br>

**REVEAL**: Your next job is to write research questions that specifically target these gaps

- Don't agonize over the perfect wording here, just brainstorm questions that would help us generate new knowledge!

- Go!

<br>

Let's hear what you've come up with!

- Everybody share one or two of the new questions from your lists that you like the best.

- Let's help each other shape these into good research questions!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Back to the revised paper assignment

**Proposal Paper 3: REVISED Important Research Question**
:::

<br>

**Assignment Prompt**

- What is the research question motivating your proposal and why is it important?

- The importance argument must show that the topic is **impactful in the political world AND fills a gap in the academic literature**
    
::: notes

Ok, so, here's what I want for this paper.

- You must revise your first paper to propose a research question that is important in both the real world impacts and as it relates to the academic literature

- My guess is that almost everyone will keep the bulk of what is in their first paper

<br>

The key change is that ONE of the premises in the paper MUST focus on the academic literature as an importance argument

- This means acknowledging the established research and showing how your question advances our knowledge on the topic

<br>

This will be due by the end of NEXT week

- **Any questions on the assignment?**

- Let's get to work!
