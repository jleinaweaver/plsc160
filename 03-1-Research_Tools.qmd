Today I want us to set some baselines in terms of the tools you will need to do and manage a research project

- **SLIDE**: Let's begin with a bibliography manager

:::



## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Install Zotero AND a browser connector**
:::

![](Images/04_2-Zotero_Download.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

FIRST things first, I want everyone to download and install BOTH Zotero and the browser connector

- When you go to the Zotero download page it should attempt to auto-detect the version of the software you need.

<br>

If you are running a computer that cannot install Zotero (Google Chrome, maybe?) you can also set up an online account and use Zotero on the Web

<br>

*Once everyone succeeds in installing Zotero, let's use it!*

:::



## Add items with ISBN or DOI {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

**Add Dr. Ponder's book: ISBN 978-1-5036-0406-3**

:::

::::

::: notes

Super easy to enter new references for any source with an identifying number:

- Books should have an ISBN number

- Articles should have a DOI number

<br>

**REVEAL**: Add Ponder's latest book

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's check the results

:::

**...means knowing what fields are important in APA**

:::

::: notes

**Did everybody succeed in entering their first book?**

<br>

Review the results (make sure the import included all key pieces and formatting is correct)

- Does this include all the details we need to produce an APA citation?

- Is all the information in the right places?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's make sure we have what we need for APA formatting

:::



## APA Citations: General Advice {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center .smaller}

**Books**

Author, A. A. (Year of publication). *Title of work: Capital letter also for subtitle*. Publisher Name. DOI (if available)

<br>

**Articles**

Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical, volume number*(issue number), pages. https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy

<br>

**Web Pages**

Lastname, F. M. (Year, Month Date). *Title of page*. Site name. URL

::: notes

The basic requirements for an APA citation

- Keep these in mind as you audit the records you import into Zotero

- These are the fields to make sure are clear, in the right spot and formatted correctly

<br>

**Questions on these?**

<br>

Now everyone check the Ponder book entries.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Now click the "notes" tab on the right window...

::: notes

I gave you links to the top 20 in political science and international relations

<br>

"More" doesn't automatically equal better, BUT more eyes on the research typically means a more important topic and a better chance that mistakes get caught!

<br>

You don't have to stay exclusively with these, BUT

- You MUST focus exclusively on peer-reviewed political science literature!

Last skills piece for today, writing an argument paper

- **SLIDE**: The Farrell (2010) piece offers excellent writing advice

:::




## Farrell's (2010) Writing Advice {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

1. Read the Requirements for the Assignment

::: notes
**What's the advice in the "read the requirements for the assignment" section?**

<br>

(Make sure you are answering the question that was asked!)

- I see this a lot and it results in a much lesser grade than the work might otherwise deserve.

<br>

Also, don't try to kill two birds with one stone (e.g. one paper for two classes)

- It is WAY harder than you think to write one paper to cover two separate class prompts. 

- Plagiarism

<br>

Also, a good chance to reinforce our AI policy in this class (as specified by the syllabus)

- You may not use AI tools on these papers

- That includes both chatGPT style generators that write from scratch or Grammarly style tools that simply clean up your writing

- One of my primary goals in this class is to help you become a better writer. I can't do that unless I see your actual writing in the assignments.
:::



## Farrell's (2010) Writing Advice {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

1. Read the Requirements for the Assignment

2. Avoid Data Dumps

::: notes
**What's the advice in the "avoid data dumps" section?**

<br>

(You may know a lot of stuff about a topic, but "stuff" is not the same thing as an argument)

- In fact, a long litany of stuff typically undermines your argument because it is distracting and confusing.

- For today you each produced 10 supporting reasons for your argument but in the final paper more is almost never better (if not tightly connected).
:::



## Farrell's (2010) Writing Advice {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

1. Read the Requirements for the Assignment

2. Avoid Data Dumps

3. Cut to the Chase

::: notes
**What's the advice in the "cut to the chase" section?**

1) Make sure your argument paper gets to making its argument from the get-go
- No, "since the beginning of time" or "Webster's dictionary defines..."

<br>

2) (Focus your introduction on making three things clear:)
1. What is the question?

2. Why should we care?

3. What is your argument.

<br>

3) (Focus every paragraph on your argument!)
- No background for the sake of background

    - **Macro Structure**

::: notes

### According to Farrell, what is a good macro structure?
- (Every paper should have a clear beginning, middle and end)

- This is probably the basic advice you've been getting since grade school.

- Tell me what you're gonna tell me, tell me and tell me what you told me.

<br>

### How do you demonstrate in the outline that your macro structure is good?
- (Differentiate the introduction from the body of the paper from the conclusion.)

4. Organize, Organize, Organize
    - **Meso Structure**

::: notes

### What is a good meso structure?
- (Each paragraph should build support for your argument.)

- (Each paragraph should focus on one main point.)

- (The point of each paragraph should build on that in the previous paragraph, and create the foundations of the next.)

<br>

In other words, your meso structure is taken care of if you clearly diagram your argument, premises to the conclusion, before you start writing.

- The work you've done this week in building that diagram is the work you need to outline and write a well structured argument paper.

<br>

### What is the exercise Farrell proposes you use to check the meso structure of an argument paper?
1. (Summarize each paragraph in one sentence.)

2. (Read the summary sentences only and the paper should both make sense AND build logically.)

<br>

### What does it mean if you can't summarize the paragraph in one sentence?
- (Paragraph is doing too much.)

<br>

I cannot emphasize this enough.
- You should check your meso structure every time you write a paper!

- An argument with a bad meso structure will NEVER be convincing.

- No amount of evidence and critical analysis can overcome this weakness.

<br>

A weak argument with an awesome meso structure CAN still be effective.
- The easier it is for the reader to follow the argument, the more likely they will be convinced.

<br>

### Does that make sense?

4. Organize, Organize, Organize
    - **Micro Structure**

::: notes

### What is a good micro structure?
1. (Sentences must be well constructed: Simple words, simple sentences, direct active language, no spelling or grammatical mistakes.)

2. (Each sentence should flow logically, from one to the next.)

<br>

### Any questions on the three types of structure Farrell describes?

3. Cut to the Chase

4. Organize, Organize, Organize

5. Exercises in Style

::: notes

**Last one, 5. what's the advice in the "exercises in style" section?**

- (Use "simple, direct writing, which communicates its arguments and evidence as clearly and unambiguously as possible" p6)

- Use the active voice (subject acts upon its verb) not passive (subject is a recipient of a verb’s action)
    - e.g. Israel is threatening to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities NOT Iranian nuclear facilities are under Israeli threat.

- Simple words are better than complex words

- Simple sentences are better than complex ones.
