Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Ideally circle up the class and chat seminar style

<br>

**SLIDE**: Refresher on science and facts

Ok, quick refresher on last week

<br>

**What does it mean to say political science uses the scientific method?**

- **What are the characteristics of that method?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## The Science in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

"The point is that the scientific method seeks to test thoughts against observable evidence in a disciplined manner, with each step in the process made explicit" (H&D p30).

- We must clearly identify and define our concepts,

- We must clearly explain our theories and hypotheses,

- We must THEN gather appropriate, high quality evidence

- We must analyze our hypotheses using data, and

- We must acknowledge the uncertainty in our conclusions

::: notes

Think of these as a set of guideposts for us in our efforts to create knowledge

- Our research methods classes are designed to help you practice these specific steps

<br>

**Any questions on these elements?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: We then shifted from science to the complicated nature of facts

### **The Half-Life of Facts**

![](Images/01_2-data-processing.jpeg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

We spent most of last class reflecting on the uncertainty in our facts about the world

- **What did Arbesman argue we should keep in mind when evaluating facts?**

<br>

- Facts have a "half-life"

- Facts can be classified by their speed of change

- Studying the spread of knowledge is valuable 

<br>

**SLIDE**: Put it all together and...

:::


## The Science in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

1. Science is a process for converting empirical observations into knowledge (e.g. the "why" of it all)

2. The scientific method prioritizes transparency and replicatability

3. ALL facts have a half-life which makes higher quality facts more valuable

4. Science is never finished, so, be humble in your conclusions

::: notes

**Any questions on our work from last week?**

<br>

This week I want us to shift our focus into "the news" more directly

- We tend to gather a ton of our "facts" about the world from the media and we should spend some time reflecting on that

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's tie this aim back into work we did last week

:::



## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

### Generally speaking, how well informed are you about current events?

::: notes

**Remind me, how did we develop answers to this question last week?**

- **What aspects of the scientific method did we embrace?**

<br>

- (**SLIDE**: Defined concepts and designed answer options)

::: notes

This was our version of being transparent and replicatable in our methods

- We wanted to be clear how we defined the concepts and how we intended to collect the data

<br>

**And what did we learn about the class from the different answers to this question?**

- **Are we a well informed group or not?**

<br>

**Was anybody inspired to read more or more widely since then? Why or why not?**

<br>

Ok, let's use your Canvas submissions for today as an answer to the question, "how can we be better informed about the world?"

- **SLIDE**

**Do you have a "good" news diet?**
:::

<br>

1. What is one source of news you rely on that you know is not reliable? Why do you use it?

2. What is one source of news you rely on that you feel confident is reliable? Why do you think that?

::: notes

Let's go around the room and gather examples of the news sources you submitted to Canvas

- *ON BOARD: Reliable vs Unreliable Sources*

- *Discuss each*: **Do we agree on these placements? Why or why not?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Introduce all the submitted news stories

**Reviewing News Stories**

1. What is the story you submitted?

2. Why do you find it intriguing?

:::
::: notes

Let's go around the room and share the stories you submitted for today.

- What are the characteristics of stories we find intriguing?

<br>

Let's examine one of these stories in more detail

- **Which story do you want to explore as a class?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Prompts

## Unpacking a News Story {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}

1. What are the clear facts of the case? 

2. Who was the likely source for this story (e.g. primary perspective)? 

3. Brainstorm research questions that this story inspires (e.g. different "why" questions) 

4. Brainstorm answers to those questions (e.g. what does your intuition tell you explains these outcomes?)

:::

::: notes

**REVEAL x 4**: *Track answers ON BOARD*

<br>

*IFF time remains, do it again!*

<br> 

**SLIDE**: Key takeaways

:::

:::: {.r-fit-text}
**Key Takeaways**

::: {.incremental}

1. Be curious!

2. Garbage in, garbage out

3. Focus on the NEWS and not the OPINION

4. Explaining "why" requires science

:::
::::

::: notes

**REVEAL**: Be curious

- YOU need to keep up with the news of the world

- The world is what we want to explain and that requires paying attention

- Read widely too! You never know what kinds of stories will inform your theories and understanding!

<br>

**REVEAL**: Garbage in, garbage out

- Your news diet needs to focus on reliable sources meaning those that emphasize first-hand, on site reporting

<br>

**REVEAL**: News NOT opinion

- Reliable source + baseline facts of an event = useful information

- Reliable source + "hot takes" = nonsense

<br>

**REVEAL**: Explaining "why" requires science!

- When you are ready to know the WHY behind those facts, go to the SCIENCE!

<br>

**Questions on the assignment or anything from today?**

**SLIDE**: For next class

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Analyzing a News Article**

- Find and unpack a NEW news article

- Details on Canvas

:::
::: notes

For next class I'd like each of you to replicate the work we just did extracting the science from the news

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Analyzing a News Article

Select a new, recent news article and unpack it as we did last class:

1. APA citation to the story
2. What are the clear facts of the case? 
3. Who was the likely source for this story (e.g. primary perspective)? 
4. What are two research questions this story inspires for you (e.g. different "why" questions)?
5. Brainstorm an answer to each of those proposed questions (e.g. what does your intuition tell you explains these outcomes?)
