**How did this go?**

- **Any trouble finding "good" options?**

- **Any articles you couldn't find the pdf for?** Send to me and I'll try to investigate

<br>

Alright, let's go around the room to hear what you found.

- Name the article you submitted and explain why you submitted this article

- While you listen your job is to 1) import ALL of these articles into your Zotero, and 2) to save the pdf

- **Questions on what I'm asking you to do?**

- *YOU DO IT TOO*

Everybody build a bibliography from all our submissions and paste into a Word document.

<br>

**Any entries look wrong?**

- We may need to tweak a few records...

SLIDE: Our next job is to summarize these research articles (e.g. prepare to annotate the bibliography)
