Prep for Class

1. TBD

<br>

On Tuesday we dug deeply into the concept of research questions

- Why do we need them?

- What makes a "good" research question?

- And how do we generate new research questions?

:::



## Science Requires Research Questions {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

A research question **focuses** your work, **drives** your progress and let's you know when you're **done**

<br>

A good question...

- is interesting, important, controversial, brief, direct, doable and puzzling (Baglione 2019)

- considers potential results, feasibility,  scale and design (Huntington-Klein 2022)

::: notes

**Any questions on the research question material we explored last class?**

Currently in Senior Seminar a group of seniors in our department are working hard to design and execute a research project

- Today we get a chance to help them do it!

<br>

This will give you a chance to see first-hand an exercise that you will be taking on in a few years

- We'll try and do this style of feedback exercise a couple times this semester

**The Prompt**

1. What is your research question?

2. What brought you to this topic? 

3. Why should we care about it?

:::

::: notes

This is the assignment prompt Dr. Ponder gave his students

- Our job today will be to review and evaluate those questions then to provide feedback to those students

- My hope is that for each question we can give them something useful in terms of what we like and what needs clarification or revising

## "Good" Research Questions {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### A good question...

- is interesting, important, controversial, brief, direct, doable and puzzling (Baglione 2019)

- considers potential results, feasibility,  scale and design (Huntington-Klein 2022)

::: notes

We'll use the criteria from the readings to help guide our evaluations

- **Any questions on the criteria before we apply them?**

<br>

*Split glass into groups, one group per submitted research question*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

GROUPS, take five minutes to review the submission and get ready to present it to the class

- Keep it simple, give us the question and your reaction to it

- We'll then work together to decide on the feedback we want to provide

<br>

Ok, time to kick off our discussions

- Each group should take notes on their assigned question

- At the end of class, each group will clean up the feedback and get it ready to return to each senior

- Then email me it to me so I can provide the feedback to the students in 494.

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles.jpg" .center}

::: notes

Next week we begin developing a class research proposal

- That means we need a research question to organize our work

### Questions on the assignment?
