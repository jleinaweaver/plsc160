**Research Tools**

- A bibliography manager: Zotero

- Top political science journals: Google Scholar

- Argument paper basics: Farrell (2010)

:::

::: notes

**Any questions on our work last class?**

<br>

I want everyone to commit to using these three tools all semester long

- Save everything in Zotero with separate collections for each class

- When I ask you for published research focus on the top-20 lists

- And always keep Farrell in mind when writing an argument paper

<br>

**SLIDE**: Big picture aim of this class

## PLSC 160: Inquiry in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

Designing a "good" research proposal requires:

- A compelling research question,

- A foundation in the academic literature, and 

- A clear theoretical story to test
:::

::: notes

By the end of the semester, you should be able to produce a research proposal

- e.g. a coherent foundation for performing a scientific research project

<br>

That means being able to clearly communicate to the reader:

1. An important research question, 

2. The state of our knowledge about that question, and

3. Your best argument for why the world behaves as it does

<br>

The best way to learn how to do this is to read widely from the academic literature

- Learn from the experts as they struggle with the same challenges!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start with the advice I assigned for reading research papers

:::

**How to Read a (Quantitative) Journal Article (Krippner 2000)**
:::

::: notes

Let's start with the Krippner advice on reading quantitative research

<br>

**What big picture advice does Krippner (2000) offer you to help you read research papers?**

- **Focus primarily on the first four bullet points!**

- Talk to each other and then report back to me

<br>

**SLIDE**: My takeaways

:::



## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**How to Read a (Quantitative) Journal Article (Krippner 2000)**
:::

::: {.fragment}
1. All research articles follow a formula
    - Intro
    - Theory
    - Data / Methods
    - Analysis
    - Results / Discussion

:::

::: {.incremental}
2. The answers SHOULD BE in the text

3. Practice, practice, practice
:::

::: notes

**REVEAL**: FIRST, all good scientific research "articles follow a formula"

- Learning to read research article is like reading a recipe for a new meal

- Each section has a very specific job and you will learn to quickly extract the key piece from each

- **Any questions about what each section typically does (as per Krippner bullet 1)?**

<br>

**REVEAL**: SECOND, you shouldn't have to be a statistician to read quantitative research!

- ALL the key info in the tables and visualizations SHOULD be described in the text!

- A well written article should explain what they did and what they learned from doing it!

<br>

**REVEAL**: THIRD, this will get easier with time, practice and more experience learning research design.

- THAT is one of the important purposes of this class

<br>

**Questions on this advice?**

- The rest of the bullet points offer useful advice for dealing with data

- Most of that work will wait until you take 296 Data analysis in the spring

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's jump to the advice from Green (2013)

:::




## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**How to Read Political Science (Green 2013)**

1. Title, Headings, Abstract	

2. Skim for Signposts

3. Read Strategically

4. Review

:::

::: notes
**Per Green (2013), how should we read a political science article?**

- **What are the key pieces of advice in this essay?**

- Talk to each other and then report back to me

<br>

I think this is really useful big picture advice

- Scientific research articles are not precious collections of complex metaphors

- They are NOT Shakespeare

- You should not have to agonize over unpacking the author's meaning

<br>

Research articles should diagram the act of doing science

- The arguments should be clearly flagged and explained!

- The methods should be clearly applied and explained!

<br>

If the basic structure of the article doesn't make sense, than that's bad science!

- That's not to say we will always understand the methods; tools are complex

- BUT all of the elements of the recipe should be completely obvious on first read

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, lets combine all this advice and use it to propose an approach to reading research articles

:::




## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**How to Read Political Science (amended)**
:::

::: {.incremental}
1. Carefully read the abstract, introduction and conclusion

2. Develop an outline of the article (bullets and p#):
    - The research question (why important?)
    
    - The key concepts (any debate?)
    
    - The main argument (key mechanisms?)
    
    - The data (sources and cases?)
    
    - The conclusions (how confident are they?)
    
3. Evaluate: What are the strongest and weakest parts of the paper? What knowledge has been created?
:::

::: notes

I will not pretend this is the only way to do this, but I'd like to talk you through one useful way to read new literature

- This is how I will ask you to explore the literature we read this week (and going forward)

- **REVEAL** x 8

<br>

So, my advice:

1. Read the abstract and introduction carefully to get a broad idea of the entire paper

2. Skim the rest to summarize these key components

3. Finally, take a moment to reflect on your summary of the paper and use it to evaluate the research
    - Critical analysis!

<br>

**Make sense? Everybody have this written down?**

<br>

**Questions on this approach before we practice using the Fortna Lotito, & Rubin (2018) article?**

:::

*Split class into small groups (3 per?)*

- Sit with your group

<br>

**SLIDE**: Before class today everybody has already read the abstract, the introduction and the conclusion so we can dive straight in!

## Fortna, Lotito and Rubin (2018) {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

:::: {.r-fit-text}

::: {.incremental}

- The research question (why important?)
    
- The key concepts (any debate?)
    
- The main argument (key mechanisms?)
    
- The data (sources and cases?)
    
- The conclusions (how confident are they?)
:::

::::

::: notes

Let's use the article to practice the steps we've been discussing

<br>

**REVEAL**: Groups, get ready to report back on the research question this paper is trying to answer AND why the authors want you to believe it is important

- (*DISCUSS*)

<br>

**REVEAL**: Ok, what are the key concepts raised in the abstract and introduction that we think need to be carefully defined?

- (*Make a list ON BOARD*)

<br>

Groups, dig into the paper and find us the definitions for these concepts

- Look for definitions in BOTH the theory section and the methodology section

- *Report back*

<br>

**REVEAL**: Groups, now we need to find the researchers' answer to the RQ

- Go to the section that ends with the hypotheses (p784)

- Get ready to report back, what are the key premises in this argument?

- (*ON BOARD*)

<br>

Ok, groups, now move to the data

- Get ready to report back, where does the data come from?

- (*ON BOARD*)

<br>

IMPORTANT: Save this list for your future self who needs to do research

- You never know what data you'll need in the future!

<br>

**REVEAL**: Finally, groups, go to the end of the article and review the final conclusions

- Get ready to report back, what are the bottom line conclusions these researchers believe we should accept? Are they confident in them?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Bottom line

:::



## Fortna, Lotito and Rubin (2018) {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### Bottom Line Takeaways

::: {.incremental}

1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this research paper?

2. What knowledge has been created by this paper?

:::

::: notes

Alright groups, only after completing this summary work can we move to the critical analysis step

- NOW, reflect on these article summaries to give us our two takeaways

<br>

**REVEAL: What are the strengths and weaknesses of this research paper?**

- (*DISCUSS*)

<br>

**REVEAL: What knowledge has been created by this paper?**

- (*DISCUSS*)

<br>

**Alright, how are we feeling with this exercise?**

- I promise this exercise gets easier and easier with practice

- You will also get faster and faster at this the more you do it!

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next class

:::



## For Next Class {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

Xu, X. (2021). To Repress or to Co‐opt? Authoritarian Control in the Age of Digital Surveillance. *American Journal of Political Science*. 65(2), 309–325.

1. Read the abstract, introduction and conclusion

2. Unpack the article and submit to Canvas

::: notes

Next week we will practice everything from today on two new articles.

<br>

For next class, you will unpack the Xu (2021) article on your own, HOWEVER, I am not asking you to read the entire article

- Just read the abstract, intro and the conclusion

- I want you to see just how much of the key info you can pull from those three sections

- We will then dig into the body of the article in class

<br>

Please do this exercise working on your own!

- I need to see where each of you are on this kind of exercise

- Think of this like setting a skills baseline for the semester

<br>
