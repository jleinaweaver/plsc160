Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

<br>

Let's keep working towards developing your literature review

- To start, let's define our term

- **What is a literature review and what role does it play in your research proposal?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## The Literature Review {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

An argument paper version of your annotated bibliography

- Make **a convincing argument** that your project builds on the academic literature in useful ways

- **Organize AND analyze** the state of our knowledge on your question

::: notes

Big picture the literature review is an argument paper version of your annotated bibliography

- Your thesis focuses on convincing the reader that your project is connected to AND advances the state of our knowledge

- MUST both organize the lit AND analyze it for the non-expert reader

<br>

**Big picture make sense?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Baglione usefully gave us a set of fundamentals we can use to make sure our lit review is hiting all the right elements

<br>

**The Fundamentals of the Literature Review**

1. What are the relevant schools?
2. How does each answer the question?
3. Strengths and weaknesses of each school?
4. Which is "best" for your project?

::: notes

**Questions on any of these "fundamentals" or anything else about the LR?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, let's discuss your work for today

:::



## For Today {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Identify and Evaluate the LR Structures in your Bibliography**

1. How is each article's LR organized (e.g. "schools")?

2. Strengths and weaknesses of each LR?

::: notes

For today, each of you reviewed and evaluated the literature reviews in the articles in your bibliography

- **Is everybody ready to go with this?**

<br>

Ok, I want you to go see everybody elses' work for today

- I want to make sure everyone is exposed to LOTS of different ways of organizing schools of thought in a research paper

- Use this as a chance to get an overview of what's out there and then we'll come back together to discuss

- Go!

<br>

Ok, let's touch base on your work

1. **Did anybody have a political science research article with no LR?** 

    - (If yes, let's check! It might be folded into the theory section)

2. **What were the most common types of "schools" across your articles?** 
    
    - (e.g. ways of grouping the answers, think of the list from last class of ways to generate schools)

3. **Which approaches to the LR did you find the easiest to read and understand?**

    - Share examples and explain what they did that made it so accessible to you.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, time to start making some decisions

**Brainstorming Schools of Thought**

:::

- What are the different ways you could group your references?

- Name each and explain the logic of the grouping

::: notes

Time for everyone to focus in on their own project proposal

- Let's do some brainstorming

- Take some time and write down all of the ways you can think of, or that you saw in your literature

- Next to each make sure to explain the logic of the grouping

- Go!

<br>

Share with the people around you and get feedback on your options

- Let's help each other get to the final choices!

- Aim is approximately three schools of thought (absolute minimum is two, BUT three is strongly preferred!)

- Go!

<br>

**Ok, how are we doing?**

- **Everybody have their three?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Assignment for next class

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**The Fundamentals of your Literature Review**

- Name, explain and analyze your schools of thought

- Details on Canvas

:::

::: notes

Everybody open up the assignment on Canvas and review the details

- **Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: The Fundamentals of your Literature Review

1. What are the relevant schools you have developed for your literature review? (you must have a MINIMUM of two schools of thought)

2. For EACH school:
  	i. How does this group answer your research question? What makes this a coherent "school of thought"?
	  ii. What are the strengths of this school? (minimum three complete ideas)
	  iii. What are the weaknesses of this school? (minimum three complete ideas)

3. Which school of thought is "best" for your project moving forward? (3+ sentences)
