**Questions on the assignment?**

SLIDE: Theory as part of the research proposal

:::



## PLSC 160: Inquiry in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

Designing a "good" research proposal requires:

- A compelling research question,

- A foundation in the academic literature, and 

- A clear theoretical story to test
:::

::: notes

The students in Senior Seminar are currently on step 3 (theory) for their projects so we thought it would be a good time to give them some feedback!

<br>

SLIDE: Here's the prompt we gave them

:::



## The Prompt: Theory {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. What is your research question?

2. What is your answer to the question? 

3. Explain the reasoning behind your answer

:::

::: notes

This is the assignment prompt Dr. Ponder gave his students

- Our job today will be to review and evaluate those details then to provide feedback to those students

- My hope is that for each question we can give them something useful in terms of what we like and what needs clarification or revising

## Science Requires Theory {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

"A theory is a set of propositions and concepts that combine to explain phenomena by specifying the relationships among the propositions. Theory's ultimate goal is to predict phenomena" (Mingst and Arreguin-Toft 2017, 72).

<br>

A useful theory, like a useful map, must:

- Be clearly specified

- Be built from logical assumptions, and 

- Accurately explain important outcomes in the world

::: notes

As we discussed on Tuesday, theories are the stories we tell to explain why things happen in the world

- Like maps, neither true nor false, but instead useful or not

<br>

**Any questions on the material we explored last class?**

<br>

*Split class into groups, one per proposal*

- We'll have each group stand up, present the work and then we discuss it

- Groups, you will take notes for the class for your assigned theory and send it to me after class so I can share it with the student

- Ok, 5 mins to get organized then we get to work!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

## For Next Week {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles_flipped.png" .center}

<br>

### Start working on the theory you will propose in your version of the class research proposal
