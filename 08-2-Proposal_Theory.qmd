SLIDE: Aims for today

:::



## PLSC 160: Inquiry in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

Designing a "good" research proposal requires:

- A compelling research question,

- A foundation in the academic literature, and 

- A clear theoretical story to test
:::

::: notes

We are now coming to the end of our preparation for writing your first research proposal.

<br>

Aim of today is to: 

1. Continue building our familiarity with the literature on our question, and 

2. To develop models for our research proposal

<br>

SLIDE: For today...

:::



## For Today {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### Developing YOUR theory / model

1. Review all of the models discussed today, and

2. Submit a list of **at least three** assumptions that COULD be important in YOUR model of religion and violence

::: notes

For today I asked everyone to pull together the assumptions that spoke directly to them from our AB.

<br>

*Split class into four groups*

- Go sit with your groups!

<br>

*30 minutes*

Groups, share your lists with each other and then use them, or some of them, to design a model for our class research proposal. 

- Your aim is to put on the board a consensus DAG and a list of assumptions underpinning your model

- **Questions on the assignment?**

- Go!

## Science Requires Theory {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

"A theory is a set of propositions and concepts that combine to explain phenomena by specifying the relationships among the propositions. Theory's ultimate goal is to predict phenomena" (Mingst and Arreguin-Toft 2017, 72).

<br>

A useful theory, like a useful map, must:

- Be clearly specified

- Be built from logical assumptions, and 

- Accurately explain important outcomes in the world

::: notes

*5 mins per model: 20 mins*

Let's give each other some feedback!

- Reminder, here's our criteria for thinking about models

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

:::



## Hypotheses {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### Per Baglione:

- A "particular type of thesis...that asserts that a specific cause (or causes) either is correlated with or leads to certain effects" (Baglione 2020, 117).

- Typically phrased in either a positive (increase in x, increase in y), or negative (increase in x, decrease in y) direction

<br>

:::{.fragment}

H3: Rebels funded by foreign democracies will be less likely to employ terrorism than those funded by foreign nondemocracies (Fortna, Lotito and Rubin 2018, 785)

:::

::: notes

With your model in place, we now need to specify the hypotheses you would like to test in this project.

- *Read the Baglione take*

<br>

REVEAL: Example from our oft discussed research article by Fortna, Lotito and Rubin (2018)

- **Is this a positive or a negative directional hypothesis?**

- (Negative! Add foreign democracy support, reduce terrorism!)

<br>

Now where do these hypotheses come from?

- SLIDE: Hypotheses are the testable implications of your model

:::



## Hypotheses {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

### The Testable Implications of your Model

<br>

**A Rational Actor Model of Voting**

![](Images/07_1-Mobile voting.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

What if we developed a rational actor model of voting

- In other words, our model assumes that individuals decide to vote or not by strategically weighting the costs and benefits of voting

- We expect individuals to vote ONLY if the perceived benefits outweigh the costs

- **Does this very simple model make sense?**

<br>

We can't actually test this model itself, but what we can do is identify what this model expects the world to look like assuming it were "true"

- **So, what is a testable implication of a rational voter model?**

<br>

- (More strict Voter ID laws (costs increase) should reduce voting)

- (Creating more polling places (shorter lines, more convenient) should increase voting)

- (Having greater wealth (resources and skin in the game of government) should increase voting)

<br>

THESE are all things we can test with data!

- Model assumptions are never meant to be "tested", they are assumed to be true

- Models lead to hypotheses which CAN be tested

- If the data supports your hypotheses then we feel more confident about the usefulness of our model!

<br>

**Make sense?**

## Hypotheses {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

### The Testable Implications of your Model

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}
Generate at least two hypotheses
:::

::: notes

*10 mins*

GROUPS, take a few minutes to generate TWO hypotheses from your model

- Put them on the board!

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

SLIDE: Let's end by discussing the structure of your theory section for the proposal

:::



## The Research Proposal {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

<br>

### The Theory Section

- Organized as an argument paper
    - Advances a thesis,
    - Has a clear macro structure, and
    - Has a clear micro structure

::: {.fragment}

- Explains your answer to the research question using a:
    - DAG,
    - Clear model assumptions, and
    - Hypotheses

:::

::: notes

*Discuss slide then reveal and discuss slide*

<br>

**Questions on this structure?**

<br>

Next class we will work on the introduction section of your proposal

- SO, think about the logic and evidence you will need to make an argument that ours is an important research question
