::: notes

Last week we started our process of completing your research proposals

<br>

The first task was to revise your research questions and importance arguments to ensure:

1. They are building on the established academic literature, AND

2. They promise to add to our body of knowledge

<br>

Today we move to the last piece of the project

- **SLIDE**: This piece is to propose an answer to your research question using a model and hypotheses

:::



## Baglione (2019) Chapter 5 {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Defining Terms**

- What is a model? (p114-117)

- What is a hypothesis? (117-120)

:::

::: notes

You will not be surprised to discover that these are contested concepts!

- So, let's start with the Baglione book

<br>

**Per Baglione, what is a model?**

- "...a model is the pictorial representation of your argument or thesis, reduced to its bare bones" (116).

<br>

**Per Baglione, what is a hypothesis?**

- A "particular type of thesis ...  that asserts that a specific cause (or causes) either is correlated with or leads to certain effects" (117).

- Typically phrased in either a positive (increase in x, increase in y), or negative (increase in x, decrease in y) direction

<br>

**SLIDE**: I'm going to be honest, I don't love these definitions so let's considers some alternatives

:::



## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Competing Definitions of "Theory" or "Model"**
:::

<br>

**Donovan and Hoover (2014)**

+ "...a set of related propositions that suggest why events occur in the manner that they do" (32).

::: {.fragment}

**Mingst and Arreguin-Toft (2017)**

+ "A theory is a set of propositions and concepts that combine to explain phenomena by specifying the relationships among the propositions. Theory's ultimate goal is to predict phenomena" (72).

:::

::: notes

Here's the definition from the reading I assign in my intro IR classes

- I like that this puts the focus of "theory" on explaining why events happen

- Baglione's definitions imply the hypothesis is what gives directionality to the theory

- This makes clear that the theory itself explains the expected relationships, separate from the hypothesis

- **Make sense?**

<br>

**REVEAL**: The Mingst and Arreguin-Toft (2017) agrees quite closely with Donovan and Hoover but adds an extra piece

- *Read definition*

- "Ultimate goal" is too strong, but I like the acknowledgement that we use theories to help us navigate in new places

- If your theory makes bad predictions, then it isn't a useful theory

- A theory of war should help us devise strategies to avoid wars in the future!

- **Make sense?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's try one more way to think about theories and models also pulling from our discussions in IR

:::

::: notes

In 2012, Primo and Clark wrote an EXCELLENT book titled "A Model Discipline"

- This book is all about the use of models in the social sciences

- It really challenges many of our preconceptions about what models are and what they can be used to do

<br>

I won't take us too deep into their analyses, but I do love the central analogy in the book

- Scientific models are like maps

- When you hear "theory" or "model" they want you to think of a map

- I really try to hammer this perspective home in Intro to IR

<br>

**SLIDE**: Map examples

:::

![](Images/07_1-US_Interstates.jpg){.absolute bottom=0 right=0 width=600}

::: notes

Here we have two maps of the United States

<br>

The map on the left is a topographical map
    
- When the lines are tight together it means steep incline
    
- When the lines are spread out it means a gradual change in elevation

- This map makes planning a hike MUCH easier!

<br>
    
The map on the right is a highway map

- Shows the main branches of the federal interstate system

- This map makes navigating across the US by car easier

<br>

**Could we make a single map that accomplishes both tasks?**

- Not easily!

- Any highway map that zooms in enough to show topography is not going to be a simple tool for cross country drives

<br>

**SLIDE**: Map with too much stuff

:::



## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"}

![](Images/07_1-Crazy_Map.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Generally there is a trade-off between the number of purposes you can use a map for and its usefulness.

- Usefulness is typically a function of simplicity!

<br>

In other words, you already know that the design of a map is important and you can't explain all things well with a single map

- **Everybody with me?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's formalize your intuition about maps

::: notes

All the intuitive grasp you have for maps goes the same for theories and models

<br>

Theories are the stories that explain why things happen, AND

- Those "stories" are designed as simplifications of reality

<br>

Theories are never true or false, they are useful or not

- Each one of these tries to explain something specific in the real world in a simplified way

- Ideally, each makes useful predictions and helps us construct new knowledge!

Designing a "good" research proposal requires:

- A compelling research question,

- A foundation in the academic literature, and 

- A clear theoretical story to test
:::

::: notes

Let's sum this all up

<br>

Research project's aim is to create knowledge

- The question focuses and frames the exercise in a productive direction

- The literature shows us what we already know about your question

- **The theory is your answer to the question PLUS an explanation as to WHY that is the answer**

<br>

**Questions on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last piece we need, DAGs

:::

<br>

```{r, fig.retina = 3, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 6, fig.height=.85, out.width='85%'}
## Manual DAG

  x = c(-3, 3),
  y = c(1, 1),
  labels = c("Predictor", "Outcome")
)

  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +

::: notes
Before we start working with theories, let's talk about diagramming a model with a Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

- DAGs are incredibly useful tools for clarifying a causal argument.

- In short, a DAG is a method for doing what Baglione wants us to do, picture an argument

<br>

**REVEAL**: *Step through the definitions on the slide*

<br>

By "predictor" I mean the independent variable and by "outcome" I mean the dependent variable

- Predictor and outcome are, in my opinion, much less problematic names for these concepts

<br>

To be clear, a DAG helps clarify your theory BUT is NOT complete

- Remember, your theory is BOTH an answer to your RQ and an explanation

- So, this DAG represents the answer BUT you still have to explain the story of this causal arrow

- In other words, your theory is a series of assumptions meant to explain why this causality exists and why it operates in this direction

<br>

**Does this make sense?**

:::



## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.retina = 3, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 6, fig.height=2.5, out.width='85%'}
## Manual DAG
d1 <- tibble(
  x = c(-3, 3, 0),
  y = c(1, 1, 1.75),
  labels = c("Predictor 1", "Outcome", "Predictor 2")
)

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 0) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-4, 4), ylim = c(.75, 2)) +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels), size = 7) +
  annotate("segment", x = -1.8, xend = 1.9, y = 1, yend = 1, arrow = arrow()) +
  annotate("segment", x = .75, xend = 2.5, y = 1.6, yend = 1.15, arrow = arrow())
```

::: notes

You can add as many variables to a DAG as want

- Here we see a model with two predictors

- **Make sense?**

<br>

DAGs can get WAY more complex to adapt to almost any model structure you can imagine

- e.g. add instruments, confounders, moderators, competing treatments, reversed causality, etc

<br>

Just remember, your theory is an explanation of why these arrows exist

<br>

*Split class into small groups (aim for four groups in class)*

- Go sit with your group and claim some space on the board

- Time to practice working with theory

## What explains the decision by Americans to vote in an election? {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

![](Images/07_1-Mobile voting.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

*Actively steer the groups to design competing models!*

- *You will need to also help them make a coherent model with assumptions that connect and build from one to the next*

<br>

Ok groups, take a few minutes to put your theory of voting on the board as a DAG

- Discuss all the intuitions you have about why people do or do not vote and transform those ideas into a model of voting

- Give us a DAG on the board and be ready to explain the logic of each arrow!

- Let's aim for four competing models!

- **Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

Ok, groups, before you present your work I want you to derive two hypotheses from your model

- IFF your model is correct, what should we see in the world?

- Give us cause, effect AND directionality, e.g. increase X then increase Y, etc

- **Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

*Mix up the groups! (aim for four groups in class)*

- Go sit with your new group!

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Diagram the Model from a Research Article

Go back to the Fortna, Lotito & Rubin (2018) paper we explored in class during Week 3 and unpack the model as we did last class.

1. What is the research question in the paper?
2. What is the DAG or DAGs proposed by these authors?
3. What are the key assumptions in the model proposed by these authors?
