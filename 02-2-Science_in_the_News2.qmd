Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Markers x A TON

<br>

Let's recap what we've done so far!

- **SLIDE**: In Week 1 of our class we discussed the "science" in political science

:::



## The Science in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.fragment}
1. Science is a process for converting empirical observations into knowledge (e.g. the "why" of it all)

2. The scientific method prioritizes transparency and replicatability

3. ALL facts have a half-life which makes higher quality facts more valuable

4. Science is never finished, so, be humble in your conclusions
:::

::: notes

**What were your takeaways from our discussions of science and facts last week?**

<br>

*If needed:*

- **What does it mean to say we use the scientific method to generate new knowledge?**

- **What does it mean to say facts have a half-life?**
    - (Facts have a "half-life")
    - (Facts can be classified by their speed of change)
    - (Studying the spread of knowledge is valuable)

<br>

**REVEAL**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's shift to our talks about news diets

**Do you have a "good" news diet?**
:::

::: notes

**After our discussions and readings thus far, who here feels they have a "good" news diet? Why or why not?**

<br>

**When is it ok to use unreliable sources?**

- **Is it ever?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: My plea to you

**Reflecting on your News Diet**

1. Be curious!

2. Garbage in, garbage out

3. Focus on the NEWS and not the OPINION

4. Explaining "why" requires science

::::

::: notes

**Any questions on what we've done so far?**

<br>

Today I want us to pick up where we ended last class

- Keeping up with current events is crucial to gathering facts, AND

- These facts generate "why" questions for you to answer using SCIENCE!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start by gathering your new facts

:::




## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Reporting Back our New "Facts"**

1. What is the source of these facts?

2. Why is this source reliable for these facts?

2. What are the facts of the case?
:::

::: notes

Everybody review the case they submitted for today and get ready to report back on the reliable "facts" we can take from it

- Remember, reliability requires MORE than just the name of the source or the reporter

- It is a function of THEIR sources and QUALITY of their reporting

- **Questions?**

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- *Make sure each can defend the reliability of the source AND the facts from this source in this case?*

<br>

From this exercise I asked each of you to submit two research questions to Canvas

- e.g. different "why" questions inspired by the facts of this case

- **SLIDE**: Let's share them

**Generating Research from the News**
:::

<br>

### 1. Write ONE of your submitted research questions on the board

::: {.fragment}

### 2. Groups select the top five questions you would most like to know the answers to

:::: {.fragment}

### 3. Groups pick ONE question and brainstorm an answer

::::

:::

::: notes

Everybody pick their strongest or most interesting of the two RQs submitted and write it on the board!

- Go!

<br>

*Split class into small groups (3 per)*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

**REVEAL**: Groups, review all the options and identify the five questions you would be most interested in answering

- Be ready to explain why you made your selections (e.g. what appealed to you about these specific questions?)

- **Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

*SHARE top five's and DISCUSS the logic for each group*

- *You put tick marks next to chosen RQs*

<br>

**REVEAL**: Groups, now pick one of the RQs from your top-5 and brainstorm an answer to the question. 

- Get ready to explain your intuition

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next class

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Developing our basic research tools**

- Bibliography managers, political science journals, and how to write an argument in political science

- Bring a computer to class!

Assignment for next class: Basic research tools

- Reminder to students: Bring a computer to next class!
