Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

2. Class plan

    - 1/2 the class reviewing the work
    - 1/2 the class exploring the "future research" needs identified in each article

<br>

**SLIDE**: Your work for today

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Unpack your Research Paper**

- Prompts on Canvas

:::
::: notes

**So, how did this go?**

<br>

- **Did everybody write in complete sentences?**

    - In future you won't remember the details so be kind to your future self and write complete ideas!

- **Did everybody include page numbers as references?**

    - Again, in future you won't remember the paper so help your future self find the details!

<br>

Ok, for the first half of class today I want you to pair off with everyone in class and review their work

- This is your chance for a crash course in a ton of cutting-edge research!

- For any articles you are interested in you should borrow their notes and add them to your Zotero!

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

**So, who did a particularly excellent job with this exercise today?**

- **In other words, whose notes were thorough enough that you had an excellent sense of the strengths and weaknesses of a given article?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our plan for the semester

Today we are wrapping up the first section of our class

- Big picture aim was to help you think about the world like a political scientist

- This meant developing a healthy news diet, and rooting your knowledge in the scientific method

<br>

For the remainder of the semester we move from talking about doing research to actually doing research

- That means each of you will be designing a research proposal from scratch!

<br>

Hopefully the work we've done so far this semester has pushed you to think about a lot of different puzzles in the world you might want to explore

- **SLIDE**: Let's use the research articles you submitted today to see what research might be needed next

**Unpacking a Research Article: Future Needs**

::: {.fragment}

- Go to the concluding section of the paper,

- Find the "future research" ideas, and

- Write them on the board!

:::

::::

::: notes

In basically every piece of published research the concluding section will include some ideas the researchers have for future work

- This may be them acknowledging the limits in their current work that need to be re-examined, OR

- Entirely new research questions that follow from their work

<br>

**REVEAL**: Everybody dig into the conclusion in their paper and find the future needs ideas

- Write them on the board!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- Take notes, these ideas are gold!

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next class

**Questions on the assignment or anything from today?**

<br>

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Research Question Basics

Complete the two assigned readings and provide answers to the following questions. Your answers MUST cite both readings (with page numbers): 

1. Why do we need research questions? 
2. What are the characteristics of a "good" research question? 
3. What are THREE strategies we could use to generate a research question?
