Prep for Class

1. Update attendance list before class

## Introductions {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Name

2. How do you "follow" the news?

3. What news stories have your attention?

:::

::: notes

While you introduce yourselves, I'll take notes!

- *ON BOARD: Sources and Big Stories*

- For the second one, help us build a list of specific news sources you follow or often see stories from

- For the last one, what specific things have been capturing your attention?
    - Try to be specific with this
    
    - Not just "the election" but what specific aspects or events tied to it have caught your attention?

<br>

My turn!

- I'm Dr. Leinaweaver.

- I have the news diet of a crazy person
    - Daily: WSJ, NYT, Washington Post, News-Leader and the SGF Daily Citizen
    
    - Plus Foreign Policy magazine and political science journals...

- *add a recent news story to the list*

<br>

Before we discuss these two lists, let's talk about why you're here!

## Required Courses in PLSC {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-PLSC_Major_Required_Courses.png")
```

::: notes
All poli sci majors must complete this set of required courses

<br>

The first three introduce you to the different specialties within political science

- **For those who have taken 101, what kinds of questions were you pushed to consider in that class?**

- **How about in comparative? Key questions explored?**

- **And in IR what were the big questions you explored?**

<br>

The second three courses, inquiry, data analysis and research design, are designed to teach you how to do your own research

- Not just read and consider how others have asked and answered big questions, but how YOU can ask and answer them too

<br>

And finally, in Senior Seminar, you put it all into practice by designing and executing a research project
    
<br>

SLIDE: Specifically, in this class we'll focus on...

:::


## PLSC 160: Inquiry in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

Designing a "good" research proposal requires:

- A compelling research question,

- A foundation in the academic literature, and 

- A clear theoretical story to test
:::

::: notes

Inquiry in Political Science is meant to teach you how to set up a research project with these three components

<br>

You will learn to:

- Develop and refine research questions,

- Identify the extent of our knowledge on those questions,

- Develop theoretical answers to those questions, and

- To communicate your research plans to others

<br>

SLIDE: Let's practice this process so you can see better what I'm talking about!

:::



## Brainstorming a Research Project {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}
1. Pick one news story and describe precisely what happened that caught your attention

2. Phrase what happened as a question

3. Give us one possible answer for the question

4. What evidence in the world would you expect to find if your answer was correct?

5. Which sources from our list would you use for gathering this evidence? Why?

:::

::: notes

Let's try this one time, working together as a class

- *TRACK ON BOARD*

<br>

We'll spend the semester unpacking this exercise and helping you better understand these steps, but in short we just:

- Designed a research question focused on a specific outcome of interest

- Designed a theory meant to explain why that outcome happened, 

- Proposed testable implications for your theory (e.g. hypotheses), and

- Evaluated available sources of data for testing your theory

<br>

**In broad strokes, does this make sense?**

<br>

Ok, pair off and do this exercise using one of the other news items from our list on the board!

- Shall we all work on the same outcome again?

<br>

*REPORT BACK and DISCUSS each*

::: notes

Congrats to all, you are know thinking like scientific researchers!

- Once you learn to think like this you will see research questions, theories and evidence quality EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK!

<br>

Even more importantly, learning to think in terms of research quality will also make you a better consumer of the news 

- As you learn how tenuous and difficult it is to produce knowledge you will, hopefully, become much more careful in the conclusions you draw about the world

- And you will come to demand more from the sources you rely on

## All Supporting Material is on Canvas  {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-Canvas_Homepage.png")
```

::: notes
Everybody log into Canvas with me and let's get oriented in our class infrastructure!

<br>

*Log into Canvas, set to student view and step them through the main pages*

- Home page,

- Grades,

- Assignments,

- Modules (with readings and assignment for Thursday)
:::



## The answer is probably in the syllabus  {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-Course_Syllabus.png")
```

::: notes

Everybody open the syllabus and let's hit the highlights!

- LOs

- Grade composition

- Attendance cliff (> 3 unexcused absences)

- Participation points

- Paper requirements: APA, submitted on Canvas, NO AI TOOLS

- Weekly plan (should essentially match the modules on Canvas)

<br>

**Any questions on our aims for the semester or my expectations for you as represented by the syllabus?**
