Prep for Class

1. Update attendance list before class

<br>

Welcome all!

- **SLIDE**: Let's kick things off with introductions

:::


## Introductions {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

1. Name

2. Majors/Minors/Certificates

3. What is an early memory of "politics" in "the news" that caught your attention?

::: notes

I can go first!

- I'm Dr. Leinaweaver

- Undergrad degree in History and Political Science, Masters in International Relations and a PhD in Political Science

- I have earlier memories, but the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 really hit me hard.

- I couldn't wrap my head around a wall splitting a city in half with one side in freedom and the other in something else

- And when it came down the Berliners threw an epic party to celebrate and I was captivated

<br>

Your turn!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Define politics

What is "politics"?
:::

::: notes

If all of your answers to my question about early memories of the political world are our data, then what does the word "politics" mean?

- **Introduce yourself to the people around you and discuss this question**

- Get ready to report back!

<br>

**Ok, what did you come up with?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Textbook style answers

:::



## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

**What is "politics"? **

- Decision-making in a community

- How we make and enforce "the rules"

- Who gets what, when and how?

:::

::: notes

*Read slide*

<br>

In various senses, "politics" is the word we use to describe how groups of people function together

- Group decision-making is complex and multilayered and that means there is A LOT to explore

<br>

In this sense, politics is one of the fundamental building blocks of our society 

- What we definitely don't mean is the noise that most people are referring to when they say they hate "politics"

- Although some political scientists study that too!

<br>

**SLIDE**: One more "getting to know each other" question

:::



## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

### Generally speaking, how well informed are you about current events?

::: notes

Here's my next question for you

- Everybody take a sec to think about this question

- Don't say anything out loud, but just think about how you would answer it

<br>

As a political scientist, I would like to use this question to learn something about you as a group

- That means I want all of your answers to actually capture something important about the class

- I'd like to be able to describe the class in terms of this answer in a simple way

<br>

**To generate useful answers to this question, what do we all need to agree on before answering?**

- (1. Define the concepts, and)

- (2. Agree on the format of the answers we will accept)

<br>

Let's first define the concepts

- **What are the concepts in this question we need to agree on as a group?**

- (**SLIDE**: "Well informed" and "current events")
:::




## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

### Generally speaking, how well informed are you about current events?

- Define "well informed"

- Define "current events"

::: notes

Ok, let's define the concepts!

<br>

**What are some strategies we could use to define these concepts?**

In descending order of value:

- (Consult the research that aims to measure the knowledge of individuals about the world)

- (Dictionary definitions)

- (Compare and contrast our intuitions, e.g. how do we each use these words?)

- (NO, NO, NO, NO, NEVER: ChatGPT or AI tools)

<br>

Use some of those, talk to the people around you and get ready to report back to me your decisions

- Go!

<br>

**Ok, how should we define "well informed"?**

- (Aware of the basic facts?)

- (Aware of the implications of these events for the world around us?)

- (Able to differentiate between fact and analysis/opinion?)

<br>

**And how should we define "current events"?**

- (What: Things or happenings)

- (When: Right now or recently)

- (Context: Of some importance to the political world)

<br>

Alright, we now all have a general agreement on what the question means

- **SLIDE**: Let's talk about acceptable answers

:::




## {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

### Generally speaking, how well informed are you about current events?

- What is an acceptable answer?

::: {.fragment}
**Measurement Types**

- Dummy

- Nominal

- Categorical

- Numerical
:::

::: notes

**If my goal is to be able to summarize the class in terms of how "well informed" you perceive yourselves to be, how could we gather your responses?**

<br>

**REVEAL**

- *Help them tease out four options ON BOARD: Dummy, Nominal, Ordinal, Numeric*

- *TRACK ON BOARD*

- Dummy (e.g. Yes or No)

- Nominal Categories (e.g. "Reads everything all the time", "Too busy to read anything", "Uses mainly social media", "Watches nightly news", etc)

- Ordinal Categories (e.g. Completely well informed, Mostly, Somewhat, A little, Not at all)

- Numeric (e.g. 1-10)

<br>

Ok, let's go around the room and answer the question each of the four ways

- *Track ON BOARD*

<br>

**If you could only report the results of one of these which would it be? Why**

- **In other words, which approach gives us the most useful data about our class? Why?**

<br>

**And with your preferred version of the answer, how confident are you it is "correct"?**

- **How uncertain are these answers in your mind? Why?**

<br>

::: notes

Ok, all of this is meant to help us set the table for thinking like a political scientist

- If your goal is knowledge about the world, then you have to think carefully about all of these elements (and more!)

<br>

**SLIDE**: If you skip these steps you end up like...

![](Images/02_1-monkey_darts_politics.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

So much of what passes for "political" discussion, argument and analysis is much like this monkey throwing darts

- A hairy fella making wild claims about the world and cherry picking results to confirm their priors

<br>

Don't be this guy!

- **SLIDE**: Be a poli sci major!

::: notes

The first three introduce you to the different specialties within political science

<br>

**For those who have taken 101, what kinds of questions were you pushed to consider in that class?**

<br>

**How about in comparative? Key questions explored?**

<br>

**And in IR what were the big questions you explored?**

::: notes

The second three courses, inquiry, data analysis and research design, are designed to teach you how to do your own research

<br>

Not just to read and consider how others have asked and answered big questions, but how YOU can ask and answer them too

<br>

These are the classes designed to teach you to be a practicing social scientist.

::: notes

All of that, plus the electives you will choose for yourself, sum together in the Senior Research Seminar

- The Fall of your senior year you will design and execute a research project!

<br>

**SLIDE**: So, let's talk about what we do in this class

:::


## PLSC 160: Inquiry in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png"  .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

Designing a "good" research proposal requires:

- A compelling research question,

- A foundation in the academic literature, and 

- A clear theoretical story to test
:::

::: notes

Inquiry in Political Science is meant to teach you how to set up a research project with these three components

<br>

You will learn to:

- Develop and refine research questions,

- Identify the extent of our knowledge on those questions,

- Develop theoretical answers to those questions, and

- To communicate your research plans to others

<br>

- Once you learn to think like this you will see research questions, theories and evidence quality EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK!

<br>

Even more importantly, learning to think in terms of research quality will also make you a better consumer of the news 

- As you learn how tenuous and difficult it is to produce knowledge you will, hopefully, become much more careful in the conclusions you draw about the world

- And you will come to demand more from the sources you rely on

<br>

**Any questions about this as our goal?**

<br>

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

1. Arbesman (2012) Chapter 1

2. Donovan and Hoover (2014) Chapter 2

3. Submit a NEW "fact" about the political world that you are confident is true (no overlapping submissions). 

::: notes

Next class we need to make sure everyone is on the same page in terms of these basic elements of the scientific method

- For that, I've given you two short readings to flesh out what we've discussed today

- In addition, I'd like each of you to help us collect some facts about the political world

<br>

Assignment details are on Canvas
