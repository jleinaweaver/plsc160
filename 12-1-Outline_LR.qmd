**FEEDBACK on the LR Fundamentals**

1. Do the schools make sense?

2. Are the analyses deep enough?

:::

::: notes

Let's take some time to share your work with your classmates

- Pitch your fundamentals to other people and see if:

1. They buy your organization, and

2. They are impressed by your analyses

    - This means your analyses convey the idea you are developing expertise in this topic
    
<br>

Let me emphasize this second point

- Your evaluation of each school (e.g. strengths and weaknesses) MUST be more than just basic descriptions of the projects

- The quality of your research proposal depends on convincing the reader you have the expertise necessary to generate NEW knowledge on this topic

- This means you help each other by pushing on their analyses, ask them to explain or deepen their work
    
<br>

**Questions on what I'm asking you to do for each other?**

<br>

Go!

- Take notes as you get feedback!

- Revise to strengthen your analyses!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next steps

**Introduction**

- Question: "What are the competing answers to this research question in the academic literature?"

- Thesis idea is that your proposal builds on the academic literature

**Premise 1: Explain AND analyze School 1**

**Premise 2: Explain AND analyze School 2**

**Premise 3: Explain AND analyze School 3**

**Conclusion**

- The "best" school for your project moving forward is...

::: notes

Let's now convert your fundamental notes into an outline for this paper

- Use bullet-points (complete sentences)

- The introduction should set up an argument paper that answers the question "What are the competing answers to this research question in the academic literature?"

- All eight articles from your bibliography MUST be included in the outline

<br>

**Questions on the structure of the paper?**

- Let's get to work!

- If you get stuck, reach out to classmates for feedback!
