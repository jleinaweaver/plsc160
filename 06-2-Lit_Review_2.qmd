### Your research proposal MUST have a literature review

<br>

::: {.fragment}

The Fundamentals of the Literature Review

1. What are the relevant schools?
2. How does each answer the question?
3. Strengths and weaknesses of each school?
4. Which is "best" for your project?

Refresh my memory!

<br>

**What is a literature review?**

- ("Taking the work of the AB a step further, the LR is a coherent essay that identifies, explains, names, and assesses the answers to your research question in an interesting way" (90).)

**Why is a LR important?**

- (Fundamentally, the literature review is how you connect your proposed project to the cutting-edge of our knowledge)

**What are "schools of thought" and why do we need them?**

- (These "groups" or "schools of thought" represent "replies that share common elements")
- (They organize the structure and logic of your LR)

**How do we generate "schools of thought"?**

- (Chronological order, Least to most preferred, By theoretical mechanism, By data source(s), By case)

**What is the structure of a literature review section?** 

- (REVEAL)

<br>

**Any questions on the LR material from last class?**
