Prep for Class

1. Make sure you have the P394 research questions

<br>

Over the last few weeks we've been reviewing the research question component of a research proposal

- Why do we need them?

- What makes a "good" research question?

- And how do we generate new research questions?

:::



## Science Requires Research Questions {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

A research question **focuses** your work, **drives** your progress and let's you know when you're **done**

<br>

A good question...

- is interesting, important, controversial, brief, direct, doable and puzzling (Baglione 2019)

- considers potential results, feasibility,  scale and design (Huntington-Klein 2022)

::: notes

**Any questions on the research question material we've been exploring?**

Currently in the Research Design class, a group of juniors in our department are working hard to design and execute a research project

- Today we get a chance to help them do it!

<br>

This will give you a chance to see first-hand an exercise that you will be taking on in a few years

- We'll try and do this style of feedback exercise a couple times this semester

**The Prompt**

1. What is your research question?

2. What brought you to this topic? 

3. Why should we care about it?

:::

::: notes

This is the assignment prompt Dr. VanDenBerg gave his students

- Our job today will be to review and evaluate those questions then to provide feedback to those students

- My hope is that for each question we can give them something useful in terms of what we like and what needs clarification or revising

## "Good" Research Questions {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### A good question...

- is interesting, important, controversial, brief, direct, doable and puzzling (Baglione 2019)

- considers potential results, feasibility,  scale and design (Huntington-Klein 2022)

::: notes

We'll use the criteria from the readings to help guide our evaluations

- **Any questions on the criteria before we apply them?**

<br>

*Split glass into groups, one group per submitted research question*

- Go sit with your group!

<br>

GROUPS, take five minutes to review the submission and get ready to present it to the class

- Keep it simple, give us the question and your reaction to it

- We'll then work together to decide on the feedback we want to provide

<br>

Ok, time to kick off our discussions

- Each group should take notes on their assigned question

- At the end of class, each group will clean up the feedback and get it ready to return to each senior

- Then email me it to me so I can provide the feedback to the students in 494.

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

## For Class After Spring Break {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

**Gathering the Literature for your Proposal**

- Find THREE political science research articles that aim to answer your RQ

- Details on Canvas

::: notes

*Read the slide*

- Everybody open the Canvas post and let me know if you have any questions on the assignment

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Gathering the Literature (I) (10pts)

Find THREE political science research articles that each:

- Aim to answer your chosen RQ (or, at least, are focused on explaining the same outcome),
- Has a pdf that you can access, and
- Is published in a journal on one of the Google Scholar "top" 20 lists (note: you can email me for permission to add articles from journals outside this list)

For each article you find:

1. Import it into Zotero and save it in a new "collection" in your library named "P160 Project"
2. Clean up the relevant bibliography fields in Zotero (if needed)
3. Download and save the pdf on your computer

Submit to Canvas:

1. What is your RQ?
2. The APA citations for your three articles, and
3. Explain why you've submitted EACH article (e.g. how it connects to your RQ or broader topic) (3+ sentences minimum per article)
