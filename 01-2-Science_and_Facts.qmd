## The Science in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-computer_scientist.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

We have two big picture aims for today:

1. We must make sure that everyone understands what it means to adopt a scientific approach to generating knowledge, and

2. We need to reflect for a bit on the uncertain nature of "facts"

<br>

Importantly, these two aims are related to each other

- It is BECAUSE facts are uncertain and evolving over time that we must use science to develop knowledge

- If your chosen method for developing knowledge is fixed it can never explain the variations over time

<br>

Ok, that got a little deep so let's step back and build to it.

- **Based on the Donovan and Hoover reading, what are the key elements to using a scientific method to generate knowledge?**

- Talk to the people around you and in 2 minutes you'll help me make a list on the board, go!

<br>

*Track responses ON BOARD and DISCUSS / CLARIFY as needed*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's see if we missed anything in my notes

## The Science in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

"The point is that the scientific method seeks to test thoughts against observable evidence in a disciplined manner, with each step in the process made explicit" (H&D p30).

- We must clearly identify and define our concepts,

- We must clearly explain our theories and hypotheses,

- We must THEN gather appropriate, high quality evidence

- We must analyze our hypotheses using data, and

- We must acknowledge the uncertainty in our conclusions

::: notes

**Any questions on these elements?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's shift to the Arbesman chapter

:::



## The Half-life of Facts {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

### What are your takeaways from the Arbesman (2012) chapter?

::: {.fragment}
- Facts have a "half-life"

- Facts can be classified by their speed of change

- Studying the spread of knowledge is valuable

::: notes

**Ok, talk to the people around you and in two minutes you'll help me make a list on the board, go!**

<br>

*Track responses ON BOARD and DISCUSS / CLARIFY as needed*

<br>

**REVEAL**

<br>

Facts change all the time (p2)

- Smoking was once doctor recommended, meat / eggs good and or bad for you, Earth was center of the universe in our models, dinosaurs now have feathers!

<br>

"Facts, in the aggregate, have half-lives (p2)

- We can measure the amount of time for half of a subject's knowledge to be overturned" (p3).

- Classified along a dimension running from "fast-changing facts" (e.g. weather forecast, stock market close) to "very slow-changing facts" (e.g. number of fingers on your hand). (p6)

- Majority of facts in the middle, **"mesofacts"** change at the middle timescale

<br>

Accepting this truth, will help you make sense of the world!

- **Uncertainty is a natural** part of the evolution of our knowledge, NOT SOMETHING TO BE FEARED!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's process some new "facts"!

## Let's process some new "facts"!  {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-data-processing.jpeg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

For today, each of you submitted a recent news story that asserts a NEW "fact" about the political world that you are confident is true

- **How did that go? Was it hard to find a fact in the news?**

<br>

Everybody open up the Canvas discussion with all of the submissions in it

- Take a couple minutes to skim through everything that's been submitted

- Think about your level of confidence in these "facts" as you read

<br>

*Split class into small groups (four groups for board space)*

- Go sit with your group!

:::



## 1. Evaluate the Submissions  {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v3.png" .center}

<br>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

![](Images/01_2-Evaluation.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

:::

::: {.column width="10%"}

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
### Confidence Level

- High (4)

- Moderate (3)

- Low (2)

- None (1)
:::

::::

::: notes

GROUPS, your first job is to review and classify all of the submissions using this scale

- Make sure to take notes on the score you are giving each fact

- **Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

Groups, now put your aggregate results on the board as a simple table

- e.g. a count of the number of "facts" in each category

<br>

Remember, each group was evaluating the same cases

**Do the aggregate results match across the groups? Why or why not?**

<br>

**What does that remind us is key about using the scientific method to generate knowledge?**

- (Science means you must be transparent in your methods!)

- (It is SO, SO, SO important to design precise instruments to ensure reliable measurements)

<br>

**SLIDE**: Next job

## 2. Rank the Submissions {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v3.png" .center}

<br>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

![](Images/01_2-cartoon_race.webp){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Top 5

- Bottom 5

:::

:::

::::

::: notes

GROUPS, your next job is to create two lists of top-5's

- List 1: The five "facts" you are MOST confident in

- List 2: The five "facts" you are LEAST confident in

- Put your lists on the board

<br>

**Questions?**

- Go!

<br>

**SLIDE**: One more step before we discuss the results

:::


## 3. Identify Key Characteristics {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v3.png" .center}

<br>

### Make Two Lists

1. What specific characteristics boosted your confidence? 

2. What specific characteristics lowered your confidence?


::: notes

GROUPS, with your scores and rankings complete I now want you to step back and generalize from the exercise.

<br>

Make two lists of characteristics for us.

- Focus on the top-5 and describe what they have in common or what they did so well

- Then focus on the bottom-5 and repeat the exercise

- After this we all report back and see where we ended up

<br>

**SLIDE**: Report back

## Let's process some new "facts"!  {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-data-processing.jpeg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

**Ok groups, give us your top-5, your bottom-5 and the key characteristics you relied on for the evaluations**

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS all*

- *NOTES ON BOARD*

:::



## Given the aim of this class is to prepare you to do scientific research on the political world, what are the big takeaways from our work today? {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

::: notes

*DISCUSS*

<br>

SLIDE: My takeaways...

:::



## The Science in Political Science {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

:::: {.incremental}
1. Science is a process for converting empirical observations into knowledge (e.g. the "why" of it all)

2. The scientific method prioritizes transparency and replicatability

3. ALL facts have a half-life which makes higher quality facts more valuable

4. Science is never finished, so, be humble in your conclusions

::::

::: notes

**REVEAL x 4**

<br>

Remember, science is a process for generating knowledge, not a bucket of facts about the natural world

- Science is never complete, our conclusions are never certain

<br>

Our job is to reduce the uncertainty in the world and we do this by being transparent in our methods and replicatable in our work

- Knowledge that cannot be independently confirmed is not useful.

<br>

Bottom line, you can study anything "scientifically."

- Even politics!

<br>

**SLIDE**: For next class

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/Background-Rally_v2.png" .center}

<br>

<br>

**Questions on the assignment or anything from today?**

<br>

Canvas ASSIGNMENT: Reflecting on your News Diet

1. Where do you most often get your daily news? Be specific
2. What is one source of news that you know is not reliable that you CONTINUE to rely on? Why? What do you like about it?
4. What is one source of news that you rely on that you feel confident is reliable? Why?
5. Submit one recent news story that you found intriguing. Give us the APA citation, and a short explanation for why you find it intriguing
